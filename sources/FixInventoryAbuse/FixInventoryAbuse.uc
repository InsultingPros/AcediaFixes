/**
 *      This feature addressed two inventory issues:
 *      1.  Players carrying amount of weapons that shouldn't be allowed by the
 *      weight limit.
 *      2.  Players carrying two variants of the same gun.
 *      For example carrying both M32 and camo M32.
 *      Single and dual version of the same weapon are also considered
 *      the same gun, so you can't carry both MK23 and dual MK23 or
 *      dual handcannons and golden handcannon.
 *
 *      It fixes them by doing repeated checks to find violations of those rules
 *      and destroys all droppable weapons of people that use this exploit.
