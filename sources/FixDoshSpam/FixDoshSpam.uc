/**
 *      This feature addressed two dosh-related issues:
 *      1.  Crashing servers by spamming 'CashPickup' actors with 'TossCash';
 *      2.  Breaking collision detection logic by stacking large amount of
 *      'CashPickup' actors in one place, which allows one to either
 *      reach unintended locations or even instantly kill zeds.
 *
 *      It fixes them by limiting speed, with which dosh can spawn, and
 *  allowing this limit to decrease when there's already too much dosh
 *  present on the map.

/**
 *      First, we limit amount of dosh that can be spawned simultaneously.
 *  The simplest method is to place a cooldown on spawning 'CashPickup' actors,
 *  i.e. after spawning one 'CashPickup' we'd completely prevent spawning
 *  any other instances of it for a fixed amount of time.
 *  However, that might allow a malicious spammer to block others from
 *  throwing dosh, - all he needs to do is to spam dosh at right time intervals.
 *      We'll resolve this issue by recording how many 'CashPickup' actors
 *  each player has spawned as their "contribution" and decay
 *  that value with time, only allowing to spawn new dosh after
 *  contribution decayed to zero. Speed of decay is derived from current dosh
 *  spawning speed limit and decreases with amount of players
 *  with non-zero contributions (since it means that they're throwing dosh).
 *      Second issue is player amassing a large amount of dosh in one point
 *  that leads to skipping collision checks, which then allows players to pass
 *  through level geometry or enter zeds' collisions, instantly killing them.
 *  Since dosh disappears on it's own, the easiest method to prevent that is to
 *  severely limit how much dosh players can throw per second,
 *  so that there's never enough dosh laying around to affect collision logic.
 *  The downside to such severe limitations is that game behaves less
 *  vanilla-like, where you could throw away streams of dosh.
 *  To solve that we'll first use a more generous limit on dosh players can
 *  throw per second, but will track how much dosh is currently present
 *  in a level and linearly decelerate speed, according to that amount.

//      Highest and lowest speed with which players can throw dosh wads.

//  - he'll be able to throw 6 wads of dosh per second;
//  but if all 6 players are spamming it, - each will throw only 1 per second.
//      NOTE: these speed values can be exceeded, since a player is guaranteed
//  to be able to throw at least one wad of dosh, if he didn't do so in awhile.
//      NOTE #2: if maximum value is less than minimum one,
//  the lowest (maximum one) will be used.
