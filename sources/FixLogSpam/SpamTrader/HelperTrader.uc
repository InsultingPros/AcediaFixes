/**
 *      `WeaponLocker` seems be an actor that was supposed to play a certain
 *  animation whenever players enter a shop. Each `WeaponLocker` is also
 *  supposed to find the shop (`ShopVolume`) it's linked to during
 *  `PreBeginPlay()` event and record itself inside `ShopVolume`'s `myTrader`
 *  variable. However this sometimes does not happen: either due to locker's
 *  placement or due to map maker forgetting to put one in at all.
 *  Since `ShoVolume`s do not attempt to check whether their `myTrader` has
 *  a valid reference, they generate log spam when it does not.
 *      Note that while `WeaponLocker` was supposed to do some action when
 *  players enter the shop, it does not actually do anything, so we do not need
 *  to care about linking lost lockers to their intended shops, we just need to
 *  link some locker to shops with empty `myTrader` references. Maps with
 *  custom animated (or otherwise somehow active) lockers should be themselves
 *  responsible that their animations are being played correctly.
 *      This fix deals with issue by either:
 *          1. Spawning our own `WeaponLocker` and assigning it to the shops
 *              with empty `myTrader`;
 *          2. Finding any already existing locker on the map and linking that
 *              to the shops with empty `myTrader`.
 *      First way is prefereable, since we prefer not to touch placed
 *  `WeaponLocker`s in case someone decides to use them correctly and makes
 *  a custom class that plays welcome animation in some shop, but forgets about
 *  `WeaponLocker`s for other regular shops.
