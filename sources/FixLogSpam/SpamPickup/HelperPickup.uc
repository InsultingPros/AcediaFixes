/**
 *      `KFWeaponPickup` class is responsible for spamming log with
 *  error messages about missing `inventory` actor: "Accessed None 'Inventory'".
 *  This is caused by `Destroyed()` event that tries to call `KFGameType`'s
 *  `WeaponDestroyed()` on pickup's `inventory.class`, but it fails because
 *  `inventory` is essentially guaranteed to be `none` for pickups dropped
 *  by players. Since no `inventory != none` check is made, this leads to
 *  log message spam.
 *      To fix it we simply disable `Destroyed()` event altogether, since all
 *  it does is:
 *      1. Fails as we have described;
 *      2. In `super(Pickup).Destroyed()` sets `myMarker.markedItem` to `none`,
 *          which does nothig for pickups dropped by players, since they do not
 *          have any `myMarker` in the first place: they are usually defined to
 *          refer to `InventorySpot`s, generated for placed pickups when
 *          navigation paths are built.
 *
 *  The are two issues that need resolving for this solution to work:
 *      1. Distinguish between pickups dropped by the player versus pickups
 *          placed on the map;
 *      2. Even if one disables `Destroyed()` event, it can get re-enabled again
 *          (possibly by a state change).
 *      One way to accomplish the first goal is to check `instigator` during
 *  `CheckReplacement()` event: it should be `none` for map pickups and point
 *  to the player's pawn for dropped pickups. If, for some reason, instigator
 *  would end up being equal to `none` for a dropped pickup, we also record all
 *  the other pickups and give them some time to initialize
 *  (`CheckReplacement()` is called at the moment they are spawned and
 *  before initialization logic is completed) and check their `bDropped` flag,
 *  since it is what decides whether log message about accessing `none`-value
 *  will be output: `if ( bDropped && class<Weapon>(Inventory.Class) != none )`.
 *  Then we also try to fix all the weapons with `bDropped == true`.
 *      To resolve issue with `Destroyed()` event being re-enabled we use
 *  brute force approach of disabling it every tick:
 *      1. Amount of dropped pickups is small enough for it to not cause
 *          performance issues;
 *      2. Checking change in state or trying to determine other causes for
 *          re-enabling the event would likely just lead to more complicated
 *          logic with around the same or even worse performance.
 *  We also enforce additional update when we catch player trying to pickup some
 *  `KFWeaponPickup` with `GameRules`'s `OverridePickupQuery()`, which is
 *  called soon before pickup's destruction. Note that this update cannot
 *  replace update inside the `Tick()`, since pickup can be destroyed without
 *  being picked up, i.e. at the start of each wave.
 *
 *      Described method does not 100% guarantee removal of the related spam
 *  messages, but should make them virtually impossible. At least on
 *  vanilla servers.
