/**
 *      This feature fixes different instances of log spam by the killing floor
 *  with various warnings and errors. Some of them have actual underlying bugs
 *  that need to be fixed, but a lot seem to be just a byproduct of dead and
 *  abandoned features or simple negligence.
 *      Whatever the case, now that TWI will no longer make any new changes to
 *  the game a lot of them do not serve any purpose and simply pollute
 *  log files. We try to get rid of at least some of them.
 *      Since changes we make do not actually have gameplay effect and
 *  are more aimed at convenience of server owners, our philosophy with the
 *  changes will be to avoid solutions that are way too "hacky" and prefer some
 *  message spam getting through to the possibility of some unexpected gameplay
 *  effects as far as vanilla game is concerned.
