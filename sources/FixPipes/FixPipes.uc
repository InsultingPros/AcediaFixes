/**
 *      This feature addresses several bugs related to pipe bombs:
 *      1. Gaining extra explosive damage by shooting pipes with
 *          a high fire rate weapon;
 *      2. Other players exploding one's pipes;
 *      3. Corpses and story NPCs exploding nearby pipes;
 *      4. Pipes being stuck in places where they cannot detect nearby
 *          enemies and, therefore, not exploding.

/**
 *      There are two main culprits for the issues we are interested in:
 *  `TakeDamage()` and `Timer()` methods. `TakeDamage()` lacks sufficient checks
 *  for instigator allows for ways to damage it, causing explosion. It also
 *  lacks any checks for whether pipe bom already exploded, allowing players to
 *  damage it several time before it's destroyed, causing explosion every time.
 *  `Timer()` method simply contains a porximity check for hostile pawns that
 *  wrongfully detects certain actor (like `KF_StoryNPC` or players' corpses)
 *  and cannot detect zeds around itself if pipe is placed in a way that
 *  prevents it from having a direct line of sight towards zeds.
 *      To fix our issues we have to somehow overload both of these methods,
 *  which is impossible while keeping Acedia server-side. So we will have to
 *  do some hacks.
 *
 *      `TakeDamage()`. To override this method's behavior we will remove actor
 *  collision from pipe bombs, preventing it from being directly damaged, then
 *  add an `ExtendedZCollision` subclass around it to catch `TakeDamage()`
 *  events that would normally target pipe bombs themselves. There we can add
 *  additional checks to help us decide whether pipe bombs should actually
 *  be damaged.
 *
 *      `Timer()`. It would be simple to take control of this method by, say,
 *  spamming `SetTimer(0.0, false)` every tick and then executing our own logic
 *  elsewhere. However we only care about changin `Timer()`'s logic when pipe
 *  bomb attempts to detect cnearby enemies and do not want to manage the rest
 *  of `Timer()`'s logic.
 *      Pipe bombs work like this: after being thrown they fall until they land,
 *  invoking `Landed()` and `HitWall()` calls that start up the timer. Then
 *  timer uses `ArmingCountDown` variable to count down the time for pipe to
 *  "arm", that is, start functioning. It's after that that pipe starts to try
 *  and detect nearby enemies until it decides to start exploding sequence,
 *  instantly exploded with damage or disintegrated by siren's scream.
 *      We want to catch the moment when `ArmingCountDown` reaches zero and
 *  only then disable the timer. Then case we'll only need to reimplement logic
 *  that takes care of enemy detection. We also do not need to constantly
 *  re-reset the timer, since any code that will restart it would mean that
 *  pipe bomb no longer needs to look for enemies.
 *      When we detect enough enemies nearby or a change in pipe bomb's state
 *  due to outside factors (being exploded or disintegrated) we simply need to
 *  start it's the timer (if it was not done for us already).

//  (`threatThreshhold = 1.0`) pipe explodes.
//      In native logic there are three cases for increasing threat level:
//          1. Zeds increase it by a certain predefined
//              (in `KFMonster` class amount);
//          2. Instigator (and his team, in case friendly fire is enabled and
//              they can be hurt by pipes) raise threat level by a negligible
//              amount (`0.001`) that will not lead to pipes exploding, but
//              will cause them to beep faster, warning about the danger;
//          3. Some wacky code to check whether the `Pawn` is on the same team.
//              In a regualar killing floor game only something that is neither
//              player or zed can fit that. This is what causes corpses and
//              KFO NPCs to explode pipes.
//                  Threat level is not directly set in vanilla code for
//              this case, instead performing two operations
//              `bEnemyDetected=true;` and `SetTimer(0.15,True);`.
//              However, given the code that follows these calls, executing them

//              threat level. Which is what we do here instead.
