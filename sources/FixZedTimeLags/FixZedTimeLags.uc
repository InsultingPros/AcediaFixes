/**
 *      This feature fixes lags caused by a zed time that can occur
 *  on some maps when a lot of zeds are present at once.
 *      As a side effect it also fixes an issue where during zed time speed up
 *  'zedTimeSlomoScale' was assumed to be default value of '0.2'.
 *  Now zed time will behave correctly with mods that
 *  change 'zedTimeSlomoScale'.

/**
 *      When zed time activates, game speed is immediately set to
 *  'zedTimeSlomoScale' (0.2 by default), defined, like all other variables,
 *  in 'KFGameType'. Zed time lasts 'zedTimeDuration' seconds (3.0 by default),
 *  but during last 'zedTimeDuration * 0.166' seconds (by default 0.498)
 *  it starts to speed back up, causing game speed to update every tick.
 *      This makes animations look more smooth when exiting zed-time;
 *  however, updating speed every tick for that purpose seems like
 *  an overkill and, combined with things like
 *  increased tick rate, certain maps and raised zed limit,
 *  it can lead to noticeable lags at the end of zed time.
 *      To fix this issue we disable 'Tick' event in
 *  'KFGameType' and then repeat that functionality in our own 'Tick' event,
 *  but only perform game speed updates occasionally,
 *  to make sure that overall amount of updates won't go over a limit,
 *  that can be configured via 'maxGameSpeedUpdatesAmount'
 *      Author's test (looking really hard on clots' animations)
 *  seem to suggest that there shouldn't be much visible difference if
 *  we limit game speed updates to about 2 or 3.
