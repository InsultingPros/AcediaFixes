/**

 *      We do so by disconnecting players who start switching way too fast
 *  (more than twice in a short amount of time) and temporarily faking a large
 *  amount of players on the server, to prevent such spam from affecting the server.

/**
 *      We use broadcast events to track when someone is switching
 *  to active player or spectator and remember such people
 *  for a short time (cooldown), defined by ('spectatorChangeTimeout').
 *  If one of the player we've remembered tries to switch again,
 *  before the defined cooldown ran out, - we kick him
 *  by destroying his controller.
 *      One possible problem arises from the fact that controllers aren't
 *  immediately destroyed and instead initiate player disconnection, -
 *  exploiter might have enough time to cause a lag or even crash the server.
 *  We address this issue by temporarily blocking anyone from
 *  becoming active player (we do this by setting 'numPlayers' variable in
 *  killing floor's game info to a large value).
 *  After all malicious players have successfully disconnected, -
 *  we remove the block.

//      [ADVANCED] Don't change this setting unless you know what you're doing.
//      Allows you to turn off server blocking.
//  Players that don't respect timeout will still be kicked.
//      This might be needed if this fix conflicts with another mutator
//  that also changes 'numPlayers'.
//  However, it is necessary to block aggressive enough server crash attempts,
//  but can cause compatibility issues with some mutators.
//  It's highly preferred to rewrite such a mutator to be compatible.
//      NOTE: it should be compatible with most faked players-type mutators,
//  since this fix remembers the difference between amount of
//  real players and 'numPlayers'.
//  After unblocking, it sets 'numPlayers' to
//  the current amount of real players + that difference.
//  So 4 players + 3 (=7 numPlayers) after kicking 1 player becomes
//  3 players + 3 (=6 numPlayers).
